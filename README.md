### PCOS prediction

# 🌸 PCOS Prediction - Women's Wellness Project

This project aims to predict **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** using various clinical and lifestyle attributes. It is designed to support early diagnosis and help raise awareness about women’s reproductive health.

## 🔬 Project Overview

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. By using machine learning algorithms, this project predicts the possibility of PCOS based on medical data input.

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing various health parameters including hormone levels, physical measurements, and menstrual cycle details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Flask** for backend API
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend UI
- **Render** for deployment
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development & visualization

## 📊 Features

- Accepts detailed health inputs related to:
  - Hormonal levels
  - Menstrual cycle
  - Lifestyle choices
  - Physical measurements
- Predicts the likelihood of PCOS
- Beautiful and responsive web form with a thematic background
- Hosted live on Render
